Complexity Analysis
The following analysis applies to all approaches.

Let N be the number of times the function was called previously.

Time complexity: O(1). Each time the memoized function is called, a single dictionary lookup is performed.

Space complexity: O(N). In the worst case, all the previous arguments need to be stored.
