// A professional implementation would need to consider several more things when dealing with function composition.

// Handling this context
// In JavaScript, the value of this within a function depends on how the function is called. When using function composition, it's important to consider how the this context of the original functions is preserved. Although the provided test cases may not explicitly test for this, handling the this context correctly can be crucial in real-world scenarios.

// One approach to handle the this context is to use the call or apply methods when invoking the composed functions. This allows you to explicitly set the value of this when calling the function. For example:

const composedFn = function (x) {
  let result = x;
  for (let i = functions.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    result = functions[i].call(this, result);
  }
  return result;
};
