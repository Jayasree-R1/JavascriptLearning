// This ensures that the this context of the original functions is preserved when they are called as part of the composed function. For more clarity, consider a scenario where the functions you're composing are methods on an object, and they rely on this to access other properties or methods on that object. If you don't correctly preserve the this context when composing these methods, they may not work as expected.

const obj = {
  value: 1,
  increment: function () {
    this.value++;
    return this.value;
  },
  double: function () {
    this.value *= 2;
    return this.value;
  },
};

// Composing the methods without preserving `this`
const badCompose = function (functions) {
  return function (x) {
    let result = x;
    for (let i = functions.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      result = functions[i](result);
    }
    return result;
  };
};

const badComposedFn = badCompose([obj.increment, obj.double]);
console.log(badComposedFn(1)); // This will return NaN, because `this` is not `obj` inside `increment` and `double`
