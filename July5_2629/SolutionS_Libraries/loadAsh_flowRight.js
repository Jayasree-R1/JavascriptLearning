// Instead of writing your own function composition implementation, you might consider using external libraries that provide this functionality. Libraries like Ramda and Lodash offer various utility functions, including function composition. By using a well-known library, you can benefit from the following:

// Robustness: These libraries have been tested extensively and are used by many developers, ensuring that their implementations are reliable and handle various edge cases.
// Performance: These libraries are optimized for performance and are likely to have better performance characteristics than a custom implementation.
// Readability: Using a popular library can improve the readability of your code, as other developers are more likely to be familiar with the library's functions and their behavior.
// Documentation: Renowned libraries usually have comprehensive documentation. This can significantly ease the development process, as you can quickly refer to the documentation for function explanations, usage examples, and more. Furthermore, many modern code editors support features like hovering over a function to display a brief description and a link to more detailed documentation. This is particularly helpful for understanding the expected behavior of library functions without having to constantly switch to a web browser.
// Here's an example of using Ramda's compose function:

import { flowRight } from "lodash";

const composedFn = flowRight(...functions);
